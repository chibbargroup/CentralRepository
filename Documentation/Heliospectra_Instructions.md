# Connecting to Heliospectra LX60 Light
Written by J. Hayes, 3/27/2017

## Purpose
This guide is intended to help users connect to the Heliospectra LX60 lamp as needed. Connecting to the lamp allows users to control the light output of the lamp in addition to controlling and setting lighting schedules.

## Basic Overview
The lamp is connected to a router which runs an independent network. The network can be accessed by either directly connecting to the router via Ethernet cable or by connecting via the router WiFi. Once connected to the network, the lamp can then be accessed and controlled via a web browser.

## Connecting to the Network
The lamp is connected to a network called `Heliospectra`.

The password for the network is `chibbargroup`

The network can be accessed like any other wireless network; simply select the `Heliospectra` network and enter the password when prompted.

Alternatively, you can connect a computer directly to the router via an Ethernet cable. In this case, simply plug in the Ethernet cable to the computer and the router, and away you go.

## Connecting to the Lamp

Once you are connected to the Heliospectra network you can directly connect to the lamp via a web browser interface. To do this, open up your favourite web browswer (i.e., Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.) and navigate to the following address:

`192.168.1.110`

This should result in a control screen which will allow you to directly control the lamp, in addition to a number of other features.

When you are finished, simply close the tab/window, and disconnect from the Heliospectra network.
